# ethiopia-fi-forecast
A data science project for analyzing and forecasting financial inclusion trends in Ethiopia using structured datasets, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboards.
# Ethiopia Financial Inclusion Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project develops a **forecasting system for financial inclusion in Ethiopia** using time series and event-driven modeling. The goal is to predict trends in the **Access** (account ownership) and **Usage** (digital payment adoption) indicators as defined by the World Bank Global Findex.

The analysis integrates:
- Measured observations (Findex surveys, operator reports, infrastructure data)
- Events (policies, product launches, milestones)
- Impact links (relationships between events and indicators)

2. Effects of policies, product launches, and infrastructure investments  
3. Forecasts for 2025–2027 for Access and Usage indicators
